# Portfolio
For this update, I focused on making the site more accessible, easier to use, and cleaner to maintain. I added support for prefers-reduced-motion so users who are sensitive to animations get a calmer experience. I also added a skip-to-content link and improved all focus states so keyboard and screen-reader users can navigate more comfortably. I updated the Quick Facts section to use proper semantic elements for better structure.

On the JavaScript side, I added a theme toggle that saves your light/dark mode in localStorage, built project category filtering for the Projects page, and added accessible form validation using an aria-live region so errors are announced properly.

For CSS, I created print-friendly styles, added a visually-hidden utility class, and cleaned up the focus ring system using custom properties. Overall, these changes aim to make the portfolio feel more polished and user-friendly while keeping the code organized and easier to build on later.
